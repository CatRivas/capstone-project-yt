eWRfhZUzrAc;10;"Hi! I just started the video lesson, and up to the point I’ve reached (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=1010"">16:50</a>), I’ve noticed something frustrating. Every time I type the code from the lesson into Replit, the autocomplete feature instantly suggests the entire completed line. It’s like it’s seen this code typed so many times that it already knows what I’m going to write! This makes it hard to practice writing things on my own because the answers are always handed to me.";0

eWRfhZUzrAc;42;Replit sadly became a pay version. We even used it in the university to study. And no I am not giving the 180 dollars a year when windows have the studio for free. <br>It is sad that we lost it.;1

eWRfhZUzrAc;65;Too Much Advertise in this video.irritating;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;66;I’m watching 11 year olds come in here to learn and here I am. A 18 year old. I can’t believe im THIS late to programming. It’s shameful. However, here I am.;0

eWRfhZUzrAc;68;"I&#39;m nearly 60 and have no idea how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors (or Blackjack) which I presume is needed to know what he is trying to do. I am not American.";0
eWRfhZUzrAc;69;Thanks for the awseome course on Python. I just want to let the viewers know if they are totally new to Python, they can avoid the blackjack game part since it is fast-paced. I understood every bits of the code since I have worked with Python in the past.;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;70;"So, as a complete beginner, the first +/- 40 minutes of this video were excellent!  Small lectures/definitions, and then a &quot;you try it&quot; exercise.  This is a great way to learn!  After that, I have spent the last <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=80"">1:20</a> trying to not fall asleep.  I did not learn ANYTHING from that.  At this point, I am not watching the rest of the video, no matter how good the explanations are.  Just sitting there saying, &quot;you can do it this way, and if you change this to this, it will do the same thing.  Now we can do this, and it will return that...&quot; doesn&#39;t allow the viewer, (me), any chance to actually put any of it to use and retain anything.  In order to learn something, you have to be able to do it.  I now move on to look for other YT videos on learning Python, having only touched on a microcosm of it in the first 40 minutes, and was completely put to sleep for the next hour and a half.";2

eWRfhZUzrAc;78;I needed to revisit python, after leaving it for 1.5 years, and yes this video is best for that, also good in fact for people like me, because actually its not that beginner friendly, or maybe that hit my mind because i was traversing it at 2X<br>But to be true its a good one to revisit or get things started without wasting time;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;79;"if this course is for beginners,  then it&#39;s a nonsense. You can do better, watch how your fellow do,";0

eWRfhZUzrAc;96;Hell yeah bro, thank you.;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;97;"Python is a versatile language used in various fields like web development, data analysis, and machine learning.<br>- Python is popular for shell scripting, task automation, and web development while also being preferred for data analysis and machine learning.<br>- It can also be used for creating games, working with embedded devices, and offers a wide range of applications.<br><br>Setting up Python environment in Replit<br>- Replit allows creating and selecting various programming languages, but we focus on Python for this tutorial.<br>- Features of Replit include code editor, output display, file management, version control, debugger, and console for Python programming.<br><br>Creating and indenting a function in Python<br>- The function is defined using &#39;def&#39; keyword and indented code within the function.<br>- Squiggly lines may indicate variables assigned but not used, which is not a program-stopping error.<br><br>Using blank lines and consistent indentation in Python code.<br>- Adding blank lines between code sections for better organization.<br>- Explaining the significance of indentation in Python code.<br><br>Dictionaries in Python are used to store data values in key-value pairs.<br>- A dictionary in Python is represented by curly braces and contains key-value pairs separated by commas.<br>- The key or value in a dictionary can be a variable, and it can be accessed using the variable name.<br><br>Using the input function to get user&#39;s choice<br>- Explaining how to use the input function to get player&#39;s choice as rock, paper, or scissors<br>- Cleaning up the unnecessary code in the program<br><br>Implementing random choice in Python for computer selection<br>- Define a list of possible options: rock, paper, scissors<br>- Generate a random choice from the options list for the computer&#39;s selection<br><br>Creating and using arguments in Python functions.<br>- Functions can receive data called arguments.<br>- Arguments specified inside parentheses when creating a function.<br><br>Explaining the return statement in Python functions<br>- Return statement only returns if condition is true, otherwise returns nothing.<br>- Can concatenate strings to display player and computer choices in a program.<br><br>F string is a simpler way to combine strings and variables<br>- F strings allow making strings with variables and other Python code by putting an &#39;f&#39; at the beginning of a string.<br>- Using curly braces within the F string allows inserting variables or any kind of Python code within the string.<br><br>Understanding elif statements in Python<br>- elif statements allow checking multiple conditions in Python<br>- Each elif statement is evaluated only if the previous conditions are false<br><br>Refactoring is the process of restructuring code while maintaining functionality.<br>- Refactoring is common to simplify or make code more understandable.<br>- Using a nested if statement can improve code readability and organization.<br><br>Summarizes the game rules and function completion.<br>- Explains the game rules with examples of paper, rock, scissors.<br>- Describes the function completion for checking wins and getting choices.<br><br>Accessing specific elements within a dictionary<br>- Using brackets to specify the key to get the value of a player&#39;s choice from the dictionary<br>- Similarly, accessing the computer&#39;s choice by changing the key to &#39;computer&#39;<br><br>Created a Python game to understand programming basics<br>- Explained basic concepts of Python<br>- Upcoming sections will cover common and additional Python features, as well as a more complex game - blackjack<br><br>Introduction to Python basics and running Python code in different environments<br>- Python can be run in an interactive prompt for quick coding<br>- Alternatively, Python can also be run in Visual Studio Code with the necessary Python extension installed<br><br>Variables in Python<br>- Variables are created by assigning a value to a label using the equal sign<br>- Variable names can include characters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start with a number or be a Python keyword<br><br>Python keywords have specific meanings and cannot be used as variable names.<br>- Examples of keywords in Python include &#39;for&#39;, &#39;if&#39;, &#39;while&#39;, and &#39;import&#39;.<br>- The Python editor alerts you if you use a keyword as a variable and turns the keyword blue to indicate its status.<br><br>Python has different data types like string, int, float<br>- Strings are denoted by quotation marks and can be checked with &#39;type&#39; and &#39;equals&#39; operators.<br>- Integers are represented using &#39;int&#39; class and floating point numbers using &#39;float&#39; class.<br><br>Python automatically detects variable type from value<br>- Python can also create a variable of a specific type using the class constructor<br>- Conversion from one data type to another is possible using the class constructor<br><br>Arithmetic operators in Python and their functionalities<br>- Arithmetic operators include plus, minus, multiplication, division, remainder, exponents.<br>- Operators can also be used for floor division, making a number negative, concatenating strings, and combined with the assignment operator.<br><br>Explanation of Arithmetic and Comparison Operators<br>- Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations on variables like addition and multiplication<br>- Comparison operators compare variables to check for equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc.<br><br>Explanation of bitwise, is, in, and ternary operators<br>- Bitwise operators are rarely used and are important to know for specific situations.<br>- The &#39;is&#39; operator compares two objects and returns true if they are the same. It will be discussed further in the section on objects.<br>- The &#39;in&#39; operator is used to check if a value is in a list or another sequence. More on this will be discussed in the section on lists and sequences.<br>- Ternary operator allows quick definition of conditional statements in Python.<br><br>Strings in Python are series of characters enclosed in either double or single quotes<br>- You can assign a string to a variable<br>- Strings can be concatenated using the plus operator or the plus equal operator to append<br><br>Common string operations in Python<br>- Operations include checking for characters or digits, changing case, checking start/end substrings, replacing parts, splitting, stripping whitespace, appending letters, finding positions of substrings.<br>- These operations return a new modified string without altering the original string. Global functions like len() and in operator can also be used.<br><br>Using in operator to check for substrings and escaping special characters in strings<br>- Use &#39;in&#39; operator to check if a substring is present in a string<br>- Escape special characters in strings by using backslash before the character<br><br>Python allows counting from the end using negative indexing and slicing.<br>- Negative indexing starts from -1, and slicing can be used to extract specific parts of a string.<br>- Boolean in Python has two values - true or false, with a capital T or F.";0

eWRfhZUzrAc;130;"After you say to remove and modify almost everything, I no longer want to continue. What was the point on writing it from the beginning?

eWRfhZUzrAc;131;"Not bad. Did not like that you type 2 lanes of code in one second and modify or remove code in a split second. Ppl cant keep up while typing their own code. The second part is not cool to write a code and then remove it because its useless or we don&#39;t need that anymore because whatever reason. You mix ppl understanding of process by doing something useless, or practising unrelated thing in a middle of game code. If u up to teach something, give ppl a reason to do it.

eWRfhZUzrAc;134;I doubt I’ll get an answer since video is somewhat old, but how do you make it for the value in the list in the rock paper scissors example to be always capitalized? <br><br>Like for example, If I type “rock” the rock in  “You chose rock. Computer chose paper.” will be lower. But if I type Rock, it’ll be show as “Rock” with capital R. How do I make it so no matter how it’s put in from the user, it will come back as “You chose Rock.” <br><br>Sorry if doesn’t make sense or hard to understand, but would love help. Thank you! :D;1
eWRfhZUzrAc;135;like the java course with visualisation in data structures and algorithm a complete tutorial make one video for python;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;136;"Big DISLIKE ! I find this video very disorganized and uneasy to follow. Not suitable for a beginner or even a person who has learned some basic stuff and is looking for some beginner level projects (me!). The key takeaway for me here is I can also do this if he&#39;s programming! No offence! but I felt I might lack an organized and clear mind to be a programmer and I realize I could be better than some current professional programmers (I kind of feel irritated by seeing this video first on my youtube which is so messy and is taken without any real cuts, any real plan)";1

Any change I make, like deleting all the return True except for one at the end of the if loop, causes problems (like running through all games in the run immediately without asking for hits or stands).

eWRfhZUzrAc;213;"This is really valuable information and I appreciate it so much . Now with that being said it has to be true that programmers think differently than most people because apparently most of the comment section found this to be one of the easiest tutorials to follow. I on the other hand felt like the examples could have been better and more structured to something we&#39;d use to produce an actual program , I know that in the end we do but I mean before that there are a lot of confusing examples with random words and functions that could have been applied better. I had to disassociate my normal thought process and keep a very open mind to what I&#39;ve known to be &quot;programmer brain&quot;lol this is why I got into coding btw I love spoken languages and have learned many on my own and always find it interesting what gets lost in translation . Many times I&#39;ve been told I should consider programming for the reason of being able to encapsulate an intent .

eWRfhZUzrAc;253;The first example of rock, paper, and scissors is not complete for checking the winner,  but the tutorial is wonderful;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;254;"For the rock paper scissors program, did anyone else do,<br><br>def check_win(player, computer):<br>  print(f&quot;You chose {player} and the computer chose {computer}&quot;)<br>  if player == computer:<br>    return &quot;DRAW!&quot;<br><br>  elif player == &quot;rock&quot; and computer == &quot;scissors&quot;:<br>    return &quot;Rock beats scissors, YOU WIN!&quot;<br><br>  elif player == &quot;paper&quot; and computer == &quot;rock&quot;:<br>    return &quot;Paper beats rock, YOU WIN!&quot;<br><br>  elif player == &quot;scissors&quot; and computer == &quot;paper&quot;:<br>    return &quot;Scissors beats paper, YOU WIN!&quot;<br><br>  else:<br>    return computer + &quot; beats &quot; + player + &quot; you lose.

eWRfhZUzrAc;298;"Beau my friend, that was totally totally superb. Covered a huge amount of ground in the 4½ hours, very comprehensive, and the blackjack app was a great practical example covering many of the concepts taught. Your explanations and presentation were fantastic. Software development has been my career since I left high school in 1979 (I haven&#39;t done much Python, however) so I learned a huge amount. Thank you so much for all of the hard work that went into this, it is truly appreciated. From one developer to another, please take care and stay safe.";13

You are the best and I let my frustration get the best of me so I ranted without first thanking you and feel kinda bad about it. So: I&#39;m sorry ????<br>Another edit: thanks for the trick to memorise the &#39;less than&#39; and &#39;greater than&#39; operators, it definitely was something that bugged me in the recent past. Another way I figured to memorise it is to see &#39;&lt;&#39; as the beginning/ foot of a mountain. In this case the mountain becomes greater on the right side. And in this case &gt; on the left. So left is supposedly greater than what ever is on the right of it..";0

eWRfhZUzrAc;355;Hi, I am not a tech person. I took computer science in 1986 MSDOS and time has passed me by. I have a question about writing and/or reading code. Question: Can a sentence, phrase or paragraph be a code or program? Please forgive my ignorance. My brother was a Junior Scientist and he wrote programs for a large soft drink company. On his deathbed he spoke to me very strangely as if he wanted me to remember his words for some reason. Now after the fact I’m certain it was code or possibly a program. Will you help me? I can email you exactly what he said. I’m not positive but he said the word Ruby. When I wrote the words he said to me I got the word Python. With some research I know there is Ruby on Rails. That’s what makes me know he was talking in code.;0

eWRfhZUzrAc;366;I’ve watched many python tutorial for beginners and I must admit- this is not the easiest one to follow. If this is your first time programming, you’re better off starting with the older free code camp video on Python taught by Mike.<br><br>1) Starting the tutorial with a program that contains functions before explaining strings and integers is disheartening to new programmers.<br>2) Moving through the tutorial you provide only brief examples of topics without any exercises.<br>3) the final exercise is 200+ lines… primarily of classes and functions that you spent 5-10 minutes explaining earlier. The blackjack game would easily take 2 hours if you wouldn’t have sped up the typing<br><br>Still I much appreciate your effort and will come back to this video after watching more Python tutorials :)<br><br>Thanks!;61

eWRfhZUzrAc;416;"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=182"">3:02</a> on the topic of the Reduce function, the lambda function you wrote seems to work when your tuple has two pairs of items in it. It crashes when you I added more pairs of items. It works for larger lists of numbers that aren&#39;t paired with another item.";1
eWRfhZUzrAc;417;This is by far the best intro python course ever made;1

eWRfhZUzrAc;419;Thank you mate. YHWH, bless you for your efforts. I am improving my knowledge because of you. Thank you again;1

eWRfhZUzrAc;423;"<b>My Opinion</b><br>I tried watching the tutorial but I can&#39;t make myself watch it since its so COMPLICATED and OVERWHELMING. Could&#39;ve been better if the video was uploaded in bits, each video about 20-30 mins. That aside, the video is too UNORGANIZED. I&#39;m just a BEGINNER but I personally feel like they could&#39;ve done a better job in organizing everything in a proper manner and then presenting it. For example, they just jumped straight into functions without explaining why they assigned values like &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;paper&quot; to the variables mentioned in the video. The thing that I did not understand was the RETURN STATEMENT. If this is a TUTORIAL FOR BEGINNERS, shouldn&#39;t it at least explain it PROPERLY. This tutorial doesn&#39;t seem to be made for beginners at all, rather I would recommend it to INTERMEDIATE AND ADVANCED PROGRAMMERS who want to revise their knowledge of python. This video claims that &quot;No previous programming experience is necessary before watching this course.&quot; but I feel that this statement is very WRONG.<br><b>Suggestion</b><br>If anyone else wants to learn Python or any other Programming Language, I&#39;d suggest that you read ONLINE ARTICLES. I learn Python from w3schools. Everything is presented in an organized manner and is easy to understand and most important of all, there are examples to explain concepts too. (By the way, this ain&#39;t promotion)<br><b>Final Thoughts</b><br>Finally, I&#39;d like to say that this is just my opinion and I may be wrong about this.This comment is to tell others that PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE may be REQUIRED before watching this tutorial. Other than that. I fully APPRECIATE freeCodeCamp for their effort in providing others a way to gain knowledge for FREE.";2

eWRfhZUzrAc;441;"Hello, I&#39;m working with statically typed C#, and I want to clarify something:<br>1) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=8575"">2:22:55</a> basically, you created a delegate &quot;increment&quot; which is an instanse of a counter(), that&#39;s why when you repeatedly call it, it preserves it&#39;s var values. Isn&#39;t it? Is there a concept of static method/variable here?<br>2) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=12200"">3:23:20</a> basically, you created a two different classes with same method name. Is it considered polymorphism here?  Is there no concept of smth like an interface here?";2

eWRfhZUzrAc;461;"hey great course :)<br>for me <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=10922"">3:02:02</a> to do next later";0
eWRfhZUzrAc;462;"Thank you for this video! It&#39;s been a great help in understanding the basics of Python.";0
eWRfhZUzrAc;463;No video clarity;1
eWRfhZUzrAc;464;Banking is not a real profession.;1
eWRfhZUzrAc;465;Did python upgrade or something? Because i have exactly what he has and it wont run at all and idk why. help;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;466;"You know you completed the course if you remember the kids saying &quot;bye-bye!&quot; :D";0
eWRfhZUzrAc;467;"Idk what the problem is but mine doesn&#39;t like your code. Maybe I have a different version on python. It keeps trying to add ALOT more stuff to the lines.";0
eWRfhZUzrAc;468;It’s so weird that Python allows a variable to be accesible even if it is declared in a definition/method??;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;469;"Just FYI,  at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=12000"">3:20:00</a>...for anyone using latest version of python (3.11), `pip install requests` command will not work...use `pip3 install requests` instead.";0
eWRfhZUzrAc;470;AMAZING COURSE;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;471;Is it a good idea to learn Python now seeing that coders are getting laid off from big tech all over the country? Are coders needed anymore?;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;472;Just finished the first 43 minutes and will continue.  First feedback, I realized Python is case sensitive.  I was constantly entering Rock instead of rock within the output and getting None printed.;3
eWRfhZUzrAc;473;??;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;474;Question...would you learn to code and work in the field with an older machine, a HP EliteBook 840 G3, but it has 16 GB of ram and 512 SSD.  or save money and get a newer Acer laptop that has the same specs, including more than one core on the processor?;0

eWRfhZUzrAc;541;With all due respect, you are not good at all at tutoring/teaching. The content is good but the way you convey your message gets your listeners lost, at least I was lost.;1

eWRfhZUzrAc;587;"Nube beginner. Although informative, this was disheartening in the very beginning. Show the full code when complete and ready to run.

eWRfhZUzrAc;593;I quit this. no more for me sorry im tired i dont understand;1
eWRfhZUzrAc;594;"Here is some feedback. These 4 hour tutorials online are very meaty to a beginner. I see great content so far in all of these 4 hour tutorials. The main problem I am having is trying to piece it all together in the way it is presented. So, I end up having to fast forward and rewind. For example, I would rather know how to assign rock, paper, scissors first at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=1165"">19:25</a> with explanation of what options means. When you only present rock, the mind wants to know what happened to paper and scissors. <br><br>So, I don&#39;t register what is said between <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=210"">3:30</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&amp;t=1165"">19:25</a>. I have to bounce back and forth picking up the commands in the order I need to learn them in. The downside to this on Youtube is 1) I can&#39;t easily scroll to the parts because the video is so long in duration. If it were chunked into 30 minute videos, the scrolling back and forth would be easier because jumping from one second to the next would be longer and easier to stop at a specific line in code, 2) if you use the 5 second rewind option you keep having to press it a bunch of times, and 3) Youtube will put ads up while you do this. Sometimes these ads erase some of the rewinding you are doing for some reason. <br><br>Shortening these videos into 30 minute sections would help immensely. With this video it would be 9 parts. The benefit to the creators of these videos is that you can see what people are spending more time on. To the student, we can watch these videos in bite size pieces instead of being overwhelmed. Also, as I have detailed above, we can scroll back and forth easier if the videos are shorter. If possible, could there be a download .pdf option to get the code so we can see what to expect further down the video &quot;chain&quot; instead of being spoon fed one command at a time? <br><br>The main problem I think beginners are having is not that we don&#39;t understand the commands. We simply don&#39;t know how to put together multiple commands to do something productive. So, think of each command like it is a star. You put a bunch of stars together and you get a constellation.  I am suggesting presenting the constellation first, so we can see all the commands upfront, what together they are supposed to accomplish, and then discuss each part one by one.";69

eWRfhZUzrAc;596;"Why not use &quot;result = check_win(choices[&quot;player&quot;], choices[&quot;computer&quot;])&quot; to call the check_win function?

eWRfhZUzrAc;611;"&quot;Python for Beginners&quot; - sorry but I&#39;m fifteen minutes in and this is - by a long way - the worst tutorial I&#39;ve seen; the narrator stumbles, backtracks, sidetracks.  There&#39;s almost no building of skills; everything&#39;s just thrown in in a mish-mash.  <br>You&#39;re trying to &#39;illustrate to educate&#39; here, but the explanations are sparse and fleeting.  New examples that are only slightly related to what&#39;s on-screen are put up, and removed pointlessly.<br>You forget to add colons in a def, &#39;=&#39; when defining a variable, and the list goes on; it&#39;s obvious you never rehearsed, or even properly scripted anything before making this video.<br><br>It&#39;s a jumbled, confusing and poorly executed.

Also, your explanation of byref and byval passing didn&#39;t seem to make technical sense, though I could be wrong. Also, I&#39;m skeptical of calling this python code a &quot;program&quot;. It&#39;s an interpreted/scripting language, and only compiled code is normally called a &quot;program.&quot; And a few times when you talked about doing things &quot;faster,&quot; it was really just more convenient, and the computer often has to do a lot more work to provide this convenience, which is typical of scripting languages. Generally, Python is slow because the code is not compiled and not optimized for specific platforms.<br><br>This course is really helpful, and correcting the mistakes helps too.

(left empty, the program error)";1
eWRfhZUzrAc;659;This is definitely not for a straight beginner. If you have NEVER coded before I would not recommend this. This is more for someone who has some experience.;1

eWRfhZUzrAc;758;"As an intermediate beginner, I should say that this is a useful course but for intermediate beginners. A full beginner should watch Mike Dane&#39;s 4 hour 26 minutes long video first in this channel. Then should watch this one. This is my opinion.";1

eWRfhZUzrAc;762;i dont like the way he started the tutorial, it was for intermidiate people and the coding of the game only confused me, he didnt explain alot during the first part. He should have taught the basics first then let us implement those basics in the RPS game. Already felt like quitting at the first part, how does he expect us total begginers to know whats def function and all that other stuff? bad idea to start with coding at an intermediate level.;12
eWRfhZUzrAc;763;anyone know how i can have two edge tabs open  at once to code while watching instead of alt+tab all the time to keep changing ?;0
eWRfhZUzrAc;764;I followed along but I can’t figure out why my return statements aren’t showing up in the game. Like <br>the parts where I enter a choice and the “you chose…, computer chose…” works but the “it’s a tie, scissors cuts paper, etc” parts don’t show up when I run the code.;0
